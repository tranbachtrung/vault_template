## Theorem ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10)
Every [[σ-field]] $\mathcal{S}$ is closed under monotone limits, so that if $A_1, A_2, . . . \in S$ with $A_n \uparrow A$ or $A_n \downarrow A$, then also $A \in \mathcal{S}$.
## Theorem (2.10, [[Bas2024]], pg. 14): Monotone Class
Support $\mathcal{A}_0$ is an [[algebra]], $\mathcal{A}$ is the smallest [[σ-algebra]] containing $\mathcal{A}_0$, and $\mathcal{M}$ is the smallest [[monotone class]] containing $\mathcal{A}_0$. Then $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{A}$.
## Proof: 


## Notes
- The monotone class theorem is a result that can be used to extend certain properties that hold for an algebra $\mathcal{A}_0$ to the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ [[induced σ-field|generated]] by $\mathcal{A}_0$. ([[Bas2024]], pg. 14)
