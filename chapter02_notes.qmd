Remark 2.1.1.

Given a Borel space $X$, its Borel $\sigma$-algebra is denoted by $\mathcal{B}(X)$.

When refering to sets or functions, "measurable" means "Borel measurable".

If $X$ and $Y$ are Borel spacess, a stochastic kernel on $X$ given $Y$ is a function $P(\cdot|\cdot)$

The family of all stochastic kernels on $X$ given $Y$ is denoted by $\mathcal{P}(\cdot|\cdot)$.

## Definition 2.2.1: Markov control model
A Markov control model is a five-tuple
$$
(X, A, \{A(x)|x\in X\}, Q, c)
$$
consisting of

a) a Borel space $X$, called the state space and whose elements are refered to as states;
a) a Borel space $A$, called the control or action set;
a) a family $\{A(x) | x\in X\}$ of nonempty measurable subsets $A(x)$ of $A$, where $A(x)$ denote the set of feasible controls or actions when the system is in state $x$, with the property that the set 
$$
\mathbb{K} := \{(x, a)|x\in X, a\in A(x)\}
$$
of feasible state-actions pairs is a measurable subset of $X\times A$;
a) a stochastic kernel $Q$ on $X$ given $\mathbb{K}$ called transition law;
a) a measurable function $c: \mathbb{K} \to \mathbb{R}$ called cost-per-stage (or one-stage cost) function.

## Assumption 2.2.2: 
We assume that $\mathbb{K}$ contains the graph of a measurable function from $X \to A$; that is there is a measurable function $f: X \to A$ such that $f(x) \in A(x), \forall x \in X$. The family of such function is denoted by $\mathbb{F}$ (see Definition 2.3.1).
