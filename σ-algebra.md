## Definition 2.1 ([[Bas2024]], pg. 11): $\sigma$-algebra
The collection of subsets $\mathcal{A}$ of $X$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if it is an [[algebra]], and in addition 
whenever $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are in $\mathcal{A}$, then $\cup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i \in \mathcal{A}$, and $\cap_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i \in \mathcal{A}$.

## Notes
- A probability or probability measure is a measure $\mu$ such that $\mu(X) = 1$. In this case we usually write $(\Sigma, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ instead of $(X, A, \mu)$, and F is called a $\sigma$-field, which is the same thing as a $σ$-algebra. ([[Bas2024]], pg. 20)
