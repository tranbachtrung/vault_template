## Definition ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10): $\sigma$-field
A $\sigma$-field in $S$ is a nonempty collection $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $S$ closed under countable union and intersection as well as under complementation. That is if $A, A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{S}$, then $\cup_{k \in \mathsf{N}} A_k \in \mathcal{S}$, and $\cap_{k \in \mathsf{N}} A_i \in \mathcal{S}$, and $A^c \in \mathcal{S}$. In particular, the whole space $S$ and the empty set $\emptyset$ belong to every $\sigma$-field.

## Examples
- [[Example - {∅, S} is a σ-field]] ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10)
- [[Example - the power set is a σ-field]] ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10)

## Notes
- A probability or probability measure is a measure $\mu$ such that $\mu(X) = 1$. In this case we usually write $(\Sigma, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ instead of $(X, A, \mu)$, and F is called a $\sigma$-field, which is the same thing as a $σ$-algebra. ([[Bas2024]], pg. 20)
