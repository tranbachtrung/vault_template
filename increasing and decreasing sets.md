## Definition ([[Bas2024]], pg. 1): increasing and decreasing sets and limits
The collection $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is increasing (denoted as  $A_i \uparrow$) if $A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \ldots$ We say $A$ is the increasing limit of $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ (denoted as $A_i \uparrow A$) if in addition $A = \cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$. Similarly, the collection $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is decreasing (denoted as  $A_i \downarrow$) if $A_1 \supset A_2 \supset \ldots$ We say $A$ is the decreasing limit of $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ (denoted as $A_i \downarrow A$) if in addition $A = \cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i$.
