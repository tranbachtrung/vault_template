## Theorem 1.1 ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10): Monotone Classes, Sierpinski
For any [[π-system]] $\mathcal{C}$ and [[λ-system]] $\mathcal{D}$ in a space $S$, we have  
$$
C \subset D \Rightarrow \sigma(\mathcal{C}) \subset \mathcal{D}.
$$
## Proof:



## Notes
- The following monotone-class theorem is useful to extend an established property or relation from a class $\mathcal{C}$ to the generated [[σ-field]]  $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$. ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10)
