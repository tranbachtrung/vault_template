## Definition ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10): $\pi$-system
A class $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of a space $S$ is called a [[π-system]] if it is closed under finite intersections, that is if $A, B ∈ \mathcal{C}$, then $A \cap B \in \mathcal{C}$.

## Notes
- [[π-system]], [[λ-system]], and [[algebra]] are more primitive versions of [[σ-field]].
