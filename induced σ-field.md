## Definition ([[Kal2021]], pg. 10): induced $\sigma$-field
If $\mathcal{C}$ is an arbitrary class (collection) of subsets of $S$, there is a smallest [[σ-field]] in $S$ containing $\mathcal{C}$, denoted by $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ and called the $\sigma$-field generated or induced by $\mathcal{C}$. Note that $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ can be obtained as the intersection of all $\sigma$-fields in $S$ containing $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$.
